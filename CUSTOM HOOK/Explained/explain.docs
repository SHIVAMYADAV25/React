# 19. Custom hooks

Custom hooks in React are a powerful feature that allows you to
encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across different components. 
They are essentially JavaScript functions that can use React hooks
internally. By creating custom hooks, you can abstract away complex 
logic, making your components cleaner and more manageable.

### Why Use Custom Hooks?

1. **Reusability**: If you find yourself using the same logic in 
multiple components, a custom hook can help you avoid code duplication.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: They allow you to separate business logic
 from UI logic, making your components more focused and easier to understand.


mostly created for clear code
can be created in js file and export it to the app.jsx
if u have complex logic u can use it and then get the value by calling the functions
which return and object or array 
that can destructure
