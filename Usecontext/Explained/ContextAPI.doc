COntext API

the context APi is powerfull feature in react that enables you to manage state across
your application more effectively , especially when dealing with deeply
nested components

Jargons:
context : this is created using React.createContext(). it serves as a container
for the data you want to share

provider : this component wrap part of your application and provide the context
value to all the desecendats . any componets that is a child of this provider 
can access the context

consumer : this components subscribes to the context changes . IT allow you to
access the context value (using UseContext hook) 

problem sa prop drilling
use context is the solution
root is App
light is parent
lightbulb is child
lightcontrol is child

so the use state is made in App 
the create Context is global
the provider is wraping the light components which next wrap the childs and also the props are getting send side by side
so the all the desecendats can access it
using the UseContext which return and object and getting destructure
