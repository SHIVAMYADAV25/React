Rolling - up the state , unoptimal re-render (bad thing)

as your application grows, you might find that multiple components need access to the same
state . instead of duplicating state in each component , you can lift the state 
up to the LCA (lowest common ancestot) , allowing the common ancestor to manage it

App => light(contain state) => (lightbulb and toggleSwitch) =>(giving the state)
