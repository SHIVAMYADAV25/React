## Atom Family

# problem
- when u are require to store more than one atom for your use cases
- eg : todos

# Atom family says
- give the the number of the component i will give u that atom
- eg
what do id u want from i will give u that data where the id match's 

# difference
- useRecoilState(todosAtomFamily(id));
id is what we pass or gets from component (props);

- normal useRecoilstate would look like this useRecoilState(todosAtomFamily);
