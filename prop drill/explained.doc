Props drilling:

Prop drilling occurs when you need to pass data from a 
higher-level component down to a lower-level component
that is serverlal layers deep in the component tree. this
often leads to the following issues:

=> complexity : you may have to pass props through
many intermediate that don't use the props themselves , just 
to get them to the component that needs them

=> maintenance : IT can make the code harder to maintain , as
changes in the props structure require
updates in multiple components.

App (contain the all state) 
that is pass down to the light (as props {bulb , setBulb})
after that they are pass to the (child which are actualy using it )
toggleSwitch and bulbShowing both are the component in the light

here the light does not even use it it just act as a brigth passing the value from 
grand parent to the grand child 

which is bad there will be proper re-render in in-proper from
to avoid this use Context API
