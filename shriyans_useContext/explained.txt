create folder with name of context 
inside that create a file name ThemeContext.tsx
in main wrap the App file into <ThemeContext> </themeContext>
so now the app is children of ThemeContext
inside the ThemeContext the display the porps using {props.children} which is app
in ThemeContext file create a context using the createContext() hook
eg => ThemeContextMode()
then wrap the children of ThemeContext inside <ThemeContextmode value={[mode,setMode]}> </ThemeContextMode>

now any where in the code which is children of app or children of ThemeCOntext can now access the data or variable pass in value
