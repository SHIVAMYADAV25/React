# Selector

A **selector** represents a piece of **derived state**. 
You can think of derived state as the output of passing state to a pure function that derives a new value from the said state.

Derived state is a powerful concept because it lets us build dynamic data that depends on other data.

selector changes its value when there is change in the Atom's value kind of depends on it
uses pure function 
when the counter is increase by 2 there is only on re-rending that is the counter
but when decresed the value the both IsEven and counter value is change so there will be re-rending of both
selector don't take default value instead it use another function value and a setter function to perform change
