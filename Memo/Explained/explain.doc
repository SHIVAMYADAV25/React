problem : when an parent elemnt re-render all the other child element re-render
to avoid this we use memo

for example use have a variable count in parent component if the variable changes only the parent component should 
be changing not the child

the child component will only change when the count variable is pass as props to its child unless and untill there
there will be not change




# memo

The reason both the components re-render is because when a component re-renders, all its children re-render as well.

## Introducing memo

`memo` lets you skip re-rendering a component when its props are unchanged.

```jsx
import { memo } from 'react';

const Buttons = memo(function () {
  const setCount = useSetRecoilState(counter);

  function increase() {
    setCount(c => c + 1)
  }
  
  function decrease() {
    setCount(c => c - 1)
  }
  
  return <div>
    <button onClick={increase}>Increase</button>
    <button onClick={decrease}>Decrease</button>
  </div>
})
```

u only need to wrap the parent component into memo and done
